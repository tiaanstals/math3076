    "Hopefully you realise that we won't usually worry quite so much about the \"trivial\" things like \"solving for the roots of a constant function\". It's all meant for the purposes of illustration. Normally you will write code for some well-understood set of operating parameters and anything outside those parameters will throw an error and cause the program to stop.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the moral of the story?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Did you notice that I reused the letters $a$, $b$? They meant different things in different contexts. But I'm guessing you didn't get confused. Math is like this, and code has good ways to reflecting it. That's the idea of the *environment*, or *namespace*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did you get the sense that the math was creating a descending hierarchy of more specific cases that sort of build on each other? Math is like this, and code has good ways to reflecting it. This is the *hierarchal and modular programing.* \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did you notice how the mathematical expression required the use of `if` statements to make full sense of the situation. Math is like this, and code has good ways to reflecting it. That's the idea of *control structures*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did you notice that the base case ended not with numbers, but more abstract ideas such as \"None\", and \"All\"? Math, and Life are often like that. Once you get really far down you run into things that are quite simple and quite strange all the same time. This is a good indication that you've hit the bottom. It also makes it clear that math, calculations, and code are here for the benefit of humans, so it should be no surprise that it sometime gives human-type responses. And for humans to make decisions, there is nothing more useful than \"True\" and \"False\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I provide implementations of all three formula discussed so far. You might notice that the quadratic formula looks a bit different from what you are used to seeing. This is because it is more *numerically stable* than the version you were taught in school. Refer to Tutorial-01 for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "These examples should give the correct answer for any *complex-valued* input. In the real world, there will be a bit of roundoff error. Sometimes this will be worse for some parameters than others. Testing is the only way to find out. "

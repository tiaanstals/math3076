    "2020 has been a wild ride. There is no denying the fact that this year we are left a little dazed and confused, and making sense of the world is without a doubt harder than it has always been. One of the major contributors to this, is the [COVID-19 epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) and the relatively large number of very new and largely hard to comprehend ideas that comes along with it. I bet if someone asked me in December 2019 what *flatten the curve*, *social distancing* or [$R_{0}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) (\"R-naught\") meant, I would have had no idea. \n",

Although *real world* mathematicians use very complex variants of these models, as part of one of my assignments this semester I had to investigate how we can use one of the simpler variants to understand COVID-19. \n",

When policy makers implement restrictions and guide the public, as I will show you below, the mathematics is the best tool to understand whats happening. "

    "[SIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) models are a type of compartmental model, whereby the population moves between discrete compartments as guided by the particular disease dynamics. SIR models come from [Kermack–McKendrick theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermack%E2%80%93McKendrick_theory) developed in 1927 and originally considered population dynamics such as birth/death rate, age group recovery functions and migration. However the models we are looking at today will only have a variable $R_{0}$ function, but I will explain this in a bit more detail soon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **SIR** model we will look at today will split the population into 3 groups:\n",
    "- **S - Susceptible**: Everyone who is able to catch the disease\n",
    "- **I - Infectious**: Everyone who has the disease/can infect others\n",
    "- **R - Recovered/Removed**: Those who have recovered or have been removed from the population\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these groups, we will then establish how the population moves between them. We use a very useful fact about [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#Ordinary_differential_equations): they allow us to describe things that seem natural (how things change over time) in a mathematical way, and then by solving them we understand how this short term behaviour leads to long term consequences. So in essence, we dont need to create a function for how many people will get infected from scratch, *instead we describe how they become infected and then solve*.

    "Sweden choose to not impose any significant restrictions on it's citizens instead asking them to voluntarily maintain social distancing protocols. Although the economic burden of such a strategy is much lower, Sweden has reported around [321 cases per 100,000 people (as of May 22).](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/sweden-coronavirus-per-capita-death-rate-among-highest-2020-5?r=US&IR=T) The only countries with higher cases per capita rates is Spain, Belgium, the US, the UK and Italy. This is an interesting strategy, and probably reflects what the \"post-covid\" world will be like. There may be no strict restrictions, but there will be a good amount of \"voluntary\" social distancing, hesitation, wearing masks etc. until we have a vaccine.\n",

    "In terms of how this would look as an $R_{0}$ function, we might expect that at the start before anyone is aware of the virus, it begins at 3.3 and then, as well as being a function of $s$, the part of $R_0$ that is determined by human behaviour may also decrease to reflect \"voluntary social distancing\". Remember from our definition of $R_0$:\n",

    "Another study I read in **The Lancet** [3](#f3) found that strict social distancing measures could achieve a reduction in $R_{0}$ of up to 60%. Since in this case of Sweden, the social distancing won't be incredibly \"strict\" I will make the assumption that *Sweden style* social distancing will only lead to about a 50% reduction in the original $R_{0} = 3.3$ number.

I would estimate the $R_0$ constructed above with 1.65 is therefore on the high side, and it may be worth reflecting an $R_0$ between 1.2-1.4"

    "### Case 3 - Australia\n",
    "\n",
    "For my last case I am going to be considering a situation similar to what is happening in Australia. We will begin with a relatively high $R_0$, which will then drop sharply to reflect strict social isolation and social distancing policies. The $R_0$ will then remain low for some time, before gradually increasing again, to simulate the easing of restrictions. In order to reflect these conditions, I will also need to consider time as a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can formulate a complete $R_0$ function, we need to do some investigation. Firstly, from the data Australia has had about 7000 cases. This since this is $\\frac{7000}{25000000} = 0.00028$, we know that from $s = 1$ to $s = 1 - 0.00028 = 0.99972$ Australia's actual $R_0$ has dropped from 3.3 to < 1 (here assumed to be 0.9). We also know that as the economy opens up, this number will likely go back up again. So firstly, we can model one part of the $R_0$ function, that by $s = 0.99972$,  $R_0$ should be less than 1. So we can begin constructing our equation:\n",

    "Now what we must consider is the time element. Essentially what we are doing in Australia is that we have reduced $R_0$ down to this level, and it has stayed there for about a month and a half. As I am writing this, it is June 1 and Australia has re-opened a lot of establishments including schools, pubs/restaurants and some other businesses. It is very hard to predict how this will affect the $R_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here I am going to have to make a few assumptions. I am doing to be slightly pessimistic, and say that for every 5 infectious cases, on average we will see those 5 cases create 6 secondary cases. This will give us a baseline $R_0$ of 1.2. So by the time the economy is *fully opened up* this is what we will see. Assuming no vaccine. We must also then work out how we place this time wise. Google Data tells me the first case was on January 25th, so essentially this will be $t = 0$. We are also working in *recovery time* units (lets say 3 weeks), so from the first case to now it has been about 18 weeks, or 6 time units. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, from t = 6 - 12, we will see the $R_0$ gradually increase to 1.2. Hence we then need to modify our $R_0$ function as follows:"

    "What is interesting here, is even though we have no definite peak within the first 30*3 weeks = ~1.8 years, the virus is still growing at the end of the time period, and the max infections occur then with 0.59% of the population being infected at that point and 95.45% still being susceptible (i.e. in 4 years, ~5% of the population got the virus) \n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens if we extrapolate further? \n",
    "\n",
    "![./aus_sir_2.png](aus_sir_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we extrapolate over 300 weeks, or ~6 years, we see that about 20% of the population get the disease at one point or another. This is assuming a vaccine is not developed, and we have an $R_0$ of approximately 1.2. It is rather interesting to look at it from this point of view. Of course this isn't a very sophisticated model, it does reflect some aspect of reality. **Until there is a vaccine, the population will keep getting the virus**. It will be part of the new norm of life. A recent study by The University of Sydney shows that lower humidity could lead to a significant increase in the number of cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the virus can very easily become a cyclical type disease, which spikes in winter time. One thing to consider is that the virus may also mutate, like the flu. This means the idea of a vaccine is more difficult, and its something we will need to get every year. \n",

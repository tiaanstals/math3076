    "\n",
    "It seems obvious that real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ are a key element of computation. But there are some subtle aspects to numbers that it's worth thinking about. We think of numbers along a line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Real_number_line.svg/1000px-Real_number_line.svg.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are told that \"almost all\" of the numbers on this line are irrational. \n",
    "That means if you throw a dart at the line you should never \"hit\" a rational number. \n",
    "The irrationals fill the entire line. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a paradox:\n",
    "\n",
    "*No one has ever met a true irrational number in person. \n",
    "We hear a lot of name dropping. \n",
    "People say things like, \"I know $\\pi$ and $e$.\" \n",
    "They are big celebrities in some circles. \n",
    "But no one's ever really seen them in their total infinity. \n",
    "Only fleeting glimpses as they run down the street and jump into a limo.*\n",
    "\n",
    "My person view: \n",
    "Irrational numbers are a convenient fiction. \n",
    "They are \"defined\" as the completion of the rationals under limits of Cauchy sequences. \n",
    "What?\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a sequence of rationals (ie \"fractions\" or ratios of integers), \n",
    "$r_{0}, r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots, r_{n}, r_{n+1}, \\ldots$. \n",
    "And say you have a way of comparing the distance between any two numbers,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large | r_{n} - r_{m} |. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now pick the smallest number you want, say 1/1,000,000,000, or 1/1,000,000,000,000, or $10^{-16}$. \n",
    "You can always find some (big) number $N$ so that  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large | r_{n} - r_{m} |  < 10^{-16}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*for every possible $m,n > N$*.\n",
    "That is, past a certain point ($N$), any two terms ($r_m,r_n$) are within this distance of each other -- not just adjacent ones $r_{n+1},r_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if someone had said $10^{-\\mathrm{googolplex}}$, we would have been able to find an $N$ for that too. \n",
    "Distance is nothing spooky. \n",
    "It's just subtraction that school kids do. \n",
    "\n",
    "We call this kind of sequence of rational number a ***Cauchy sequence***. \n",
    "It looks like it's going somewhere.\n",
    "But at every step of the way, it's just a bunch of rational numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about these kinds of sequences is that there may not be a rational number at the end of it. \n",
    "The definition is to just make a bigger set of numbers that includes these limits and go on our way as if nothing was ever awkward.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The point is that real numbers are* ***algorithms***. \n",
    "At least the only ones we can ever actually talk about. \n",
    "If you can't compute it, then it doesn't exist. \n",
    "Most hypothetical \"real\" numbers that we can pretend to think about are sequences that we could never actually generate with any algorithm. \n",
    "We are stuck with the ***common-sense*** computational approach. "
